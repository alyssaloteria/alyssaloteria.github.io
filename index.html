        <p class="lead mb-4">Violinist, Bassist, and Percussionist - Extensive knowledge in multiple and varying areas of music performance. From the sophisticated nature of classical orchestra, to the theatrical, massive attributes of marching band, and learning the nuanced, stylish essence of jazz - I have unique and pleasant experiences studying the factors that go into the spectrum of performance. As a student also studying music as a whole, I explore the importance of knowledge of musical theory and its connection to better personal practice, as well as different genres, their overlaps, and inspiring figures who represent each genre.<br><br>

        When I first picked up violin at the age of seven, I knew I felt a connection - not just to the notes on the pages of my lesson book, but to those who also enjoyed the feeling when a passage is played just right, or the satisfaction from thundering applause. Being a typical student who began in private lessons and worked up to playing with a symphony orchestra, I have recognized what it means "enjoy" music. There is not only focus on correcting intonation and technical issues, but also emphasis on stage presence, learning to collaborate with other musicians, and having the self-discipline to know your own skill. However, above all of the nitpicking about what makes a musical performance an outstanding one, I believe that personal enjoyment of the art is what takes an individual from a performer to a musician. Though I have been trained classically, arguably the music world's definition of "correct," I believe that different areas of music require more than just theory mastering. A student could be a prodigy, play solos with little to no mistakes, and just exhibit the picture perfect "musician" - but they play with no emotion. Although every area of music requires discipline in learning fundamentals, they would all come together under the same agreement that a performer who plays with their heart and not just the brain is one that will go farthest in their musical career. From an audience standpoint, a soloist who expresses their practice over their facial expression and body movement is far more moving than simply a clean solo. Overall, music performance comes across from the attention to detail in personal expression of pre-existing musical structure.     <br><br>

As for the details of my experience, I have 12+ years of classical/orchestral string experience with violin, along with consistent private lessons up until the age of 18. I have participated in community, district, and honor orchestras, some as a principal member. I currently serve as a student in my university's symphony orchestra. My jazz knowledge is, admittedly, much less, with just under 6 months of electric jazz bass training but a concentration on jazz theory. As for percussive experience, I have 2 years, or 4 complete seasons in competitive marching band and independent drumline, with a captain role in drumline for the entire two years. I also have exposure to playing in an international marching band, and I am currently working sales for percussion-endorsing merchandise brand meant to create connections through percussion students.        </p>
